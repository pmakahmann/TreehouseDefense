# TreehouseDefense

About:

My first C# project from Treehouse as a Tower Defense game.

This program will run only in the console. There is no GUI component yet.

To Run:

1. Start by downloading or cloning the TreehouseDefense folder.
2. Download and install the "Mono" compiler from http://www.mono-project.com/download (or use your own compiler).
3. In your console or command prompt, navigate to the TreehouseDefense folder location.
4. Compile and run by executing the command: mcs -out:TreehouseDefense.exe *.cs && mono TreehouseDefense.exe.
